# Project1-Snake_game

 •Snake Game using C++
 
 A fun and simple Snake Game built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Navigate the snake, eat food, and avoid crashing into the borders!

 #️⃣Features:
- Tried to cover all the necessary points mentioned in the Project 1 Document.
- Classic snake gameplay on a *25x50 grid*
- Modular design for easy readability and modifications
- Real-time user input handling
- As the snake eats the food (represented using symbol "*" )the lenght increases 
- Displays final score when the snake crashes
- Works on multiple operating systems *(no `conio.h` required!)* 
  (made own header file to read input)

#️⃣Controls:

- **Key**: Move Snake (Up-"W", Down-"S", Left-"A", Right-"D")

#️⃣About SnakeInput.h:

•The SnakeInput.h file handles user input for controlling the snake in the game.    It  uses Windows-specific functions (GetAsyncKeyState) to detect key presses without blocking program execution.

•Detects WASD or arrow keys for movement.

•Uses GetAsyncKeyState() for real-time key detection.

•Returns \0 when no key is pressed, preventing unnecessary direction changes.


#️⃣Limitations:

-This Snake Game is designed to **work on Windows OS**. It utilizes Windows-specific
 libraries such as *windows.h* for console manipulation (SetConsoleCursorPosition, Sleep, and system("cls")).

 Compatibility with other operating systems like Linux or macOS is not guaranteed without modifications.

-Designed for terminal play, no GUI support.
